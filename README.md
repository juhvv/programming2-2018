This repository contains programming assignments from course "Programming 2". The focus of this course was on basics of C++ programming and object-oriented programming. The basic usage of Git version control and Qt Creator were also covered on this course.
There was one "major" programming assignment, in which the student had to implement a slot game program. This assignment can be found in "student/11/slots".

__This repository also includes the course-side code. My code is located in "student" folder.__
