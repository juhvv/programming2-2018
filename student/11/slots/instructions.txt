Game instructions:
Player inserts money by clicking the "money insert slot" (= black button under 'insert 0.10$').
As the name suggests, this adds 0.10$ for the player. Current player money is
displayed in the 'money' lcd display. Current bet is set with the slider under 'BET', 0.05$ or
0.20$. Game can be started when player has enough money for the selected bet. Reels spin for
random time and stop in order. Wins are read from the middle row. In case of a win, winning
money is immediately added to players  total money.
Reels can be locked before starting a spin, unless...
A) Player won with the previous spin.
OR
B) At least one reel was locked during previous spin.

Additionally, at least one reel has to be unlocked to start a game. Total winnings/losses are
displayed in the 'balance' lcd display. The game ends when the player no longer wants to
insert more money (realistic?).
Winning sum is determined by multiplying the current bet with multiplier defined for that row.

of multiple win cases, one with the largest multiplier is taken into account. Winning

        3 cherries
        3 strawberries
        2 oranges
